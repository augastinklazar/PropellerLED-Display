; This code is for a Propeller LED Display project in assembly language.
; The display consists of a rotating array of LEDs that can be used to display characters, numbers, and symbols.

; The following registers are used:
; - R0: The current character being displayed
; - R1: The position of the display
; - R2: The speed of the display

; The setup() function is called once, when the Propeller starts up.
setup:
  ; Initialize the display
  mov R0, #'A'
  mov R1, #0
  mov R2, #100

; The loop() function is called repeatedly, as long as the Propeller is running.
loop:
  ; Increment the position of the display
  inc R1

  ; If the position of the display is greater than the number of LEDs,
  ; reset the position to 0.
  cmp R1, LED_COUNT
  jge reset_position

  ; Display the current character
  mov LED[R1], R0

  ; Wait for the specified amount of time.
  delay R2

  ; Go to the next character.
  jmp next_character

; The reset_position() function resets the position of the display to 0.
reset_position:
  mov R1, #0

; The next_character() function increments the current character and goes to the loop() function.
next_character:
  inc R0
  jmp loop
